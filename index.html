            <h2>
                The story
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came 
                around to commiserate. They said,
            </p>    
                <blockquote class="voisins">
                    <cite>
                        “We are so sorry to hear your horse 
                        has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
                    </cite>
                </blockquote> 
            <p>
                The farmer said,
            </p> 
                <blockquote class="farmer">
                    <cite>
                        “Maybe.”
                    </cite>
                </blockquote> 
            <p>    
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came 
                back and said,
            </p>    
                <blockquote class="voisins">
                    <cite>
                        “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”
                    </cite>
                </blockquote>
            <p>
                The farmer again said,
            </p>     
                <blockquote class="farmer">
                    <cite>
                        “Maybe.”
                    </cite>
                </blockquote>
            <p>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke 
                his leg. The neighbors then said,
            </p>     
                <blockquote class="voisins">
                    <cite>
                        “Oh dear, that’s too bad,”
                    </cite>
                </blockquote> 
            <p>    
                and the farmer responded,
            </p>    
                <blockquote class="farmer">
                    <cite>
                        “Maybe.”
                    </cite>
                </blockquote> 
            <p>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected 
                his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
            </p>    
                <blockquote class="voisins">
                    <cite>
                        “Isn’t that great!”
                    </cite>
                </blockquote> 
            <p>
                Again, he said,
            </p>
                <blockquote class="farmer">
                    <cite>
                        “Maybe.”
                    </cite>
                </blockquote>
            <p>
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to 
                tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the 
                consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

                <p>
                    Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
